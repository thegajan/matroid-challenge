# matroid-challenge
My solutions for the Matroid machine learning challenge.

To view my results launch the jupyter notebook with my expirement. Use Python3.6.
To run training place [data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/matroid-web/datasets/agegender_cleaned.tar.gz) in the /data directory.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-notebook vgg-tf.ipynb
```

The code snippets can be run from the jupyter notebook.
